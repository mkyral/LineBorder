TRANSLATIONS

To translate LineBorder 2 to your language you need to get the .po file,
translate it, test it and sent it to me (mkyral@email.cz)

1) Get the .po file
-------------------

There are basicaly three ways:

  a) If you have linux, just put your locale code to the
     LineBorder/po/LINGUAS file and run command ./msg.sh -u
     in the po directory and new .po file will be created there.

  b) Sent me an email and I'll generate the file for you.

  c) Use existing .po file for different languge.

2) Translation
--------------

  You can use any text editor, but better is to use a special editor,
  like lokalize (KDE)
       poedit (Linux, Windows, Mac OS X) - http://www.poedit.net/
       a lot of others.

3) Testing
----------

  On linux)
      You can use the LineBorder/po/msg.sh program with
      parameter "-c". This will compile the file and install it
      to the LineBorder/locale/<locale_code>/ directory:   ./msg.sh -c

  On windows)
      a) You will need gettext tools for window.
      b) Compile the .po file:
           msgfmt.exe --output-file=LineBorder.mo <po_file>

      c) Copy the .mo file to LineBorder\locale\<locale_code>\LC_MESSAGES\

  Both) Start Gimp, and check if it is translated.

4) Publish your translation
---------------------------

  Set the translation file to me and I'll include it in next releaase.
